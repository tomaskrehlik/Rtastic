      <p>The data comes from a unpublished master's paper by Carl Hoffstedt. They relate the automobile accident rate, 
in accidents per million vehicle miles to several potential terms.  The data include 39 sections of large 
highways in the state of Minnesota in 1973.  The goal of this analysis was to understand the impact 
of design variables, <code>Acpts</code>, <code>Slim</code>, <code>Sig</code>, and <code>Shld</code> that are under the control of 
the highway department, on accidents.</p>
